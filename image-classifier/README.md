# Image Classifier

Classifying types of flowers using Convolutional Neural Networks.

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, first code for an image classifier built with PyTorch was developed, then it was converted into a command line application.

CLI usage:
Train a new network on a data set with train.py:
 * Basic usage: `python train.py data_directory` (Prints out training loss, validation loss, and validation accuracy as the network trains)
 * 
 *
